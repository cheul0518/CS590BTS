Decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum
1. Abstract
  - This paper presnets a measurement study on various decentralization metrics of two of the leading cryptocurries 
  with the largest market capitalization and the userbase, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  - How to investigate the extent of decentralization? Measuring...
    1. The network resources of nodes and the interconnections among them
    2. The protocol requirements affecting the operation of nodes
    3. The robustness of the two systems against attacks.
    - Particulary Falcon Relay Network as a novel measurement tool
  - The paper concludes neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has strictly better properties that the other
  - The paper suggests how to improve both systems
