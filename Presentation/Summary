Decentralization in Bitcoin and Ethereum
1. Abstract
  - This paper presnets a measurement study on various decentralization metrics of two of the leading cryptocurries 
  with the largest market capitalization and the userbase, Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  - How to investigate the extent of decentralization? Measuring...
    1. The network resources of nodes and the interconnections among them
    2. The protocol requirements affecting the operation of nodes
    3. The robustness of the two systems against attacks.
    - Particulary Falcon Relay Network as a novel measurement tool
  - The paper concludes neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has strictly better properties that the other
  - The paper suggests how to improve both systems

2. Introduction
  - Bitcoin and Ethereum account for over 70% of cryptocurrency market.
  - The blockchain technology achieves consensus in a decentralized, open system and enables innovation in industries
  that conventionally relied upon trusted authorities: land record managemen, domain name registration, voting, etc
  - Decentralization is the key feature that empowers such services and makes these platforms interesting
  - Decentralization is a property regarding the fragmentation of control over the protocol
  - In other words, better decentraliazation of miners means higher resistance against censorship of individual transactions
  - This paper presents a comprehensive measurement study on decentralization metrics in these operational systems and
  shed light on whether or not existing assumptions are satisfied in practice. This approach is different from the traditional
  approaches that are based on assumptions.
  - This research sources are
    1. Direct measurements of these networks from multiple vantage points
    2. A Bitcoin relay network called Falcon that the researcher deplyed and operated for a year
    3. Blockchain histories of Bitcoin and Ethereum
  - The research findings regards the network properties, impact of  protocol requirements, security, and client interactions
  - The paper makes three contribution
    1. Providing new tools and techniques for measuring blockchain-based cryptocurry networks: Falcon relay network 
    2. Performing a comparative study of decentralization metrics in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key findings are
      1. The Bitcoin network can increased the bandwidth requirements for nodes by a factor of 1.7 and keep the same level
      of decentralization as 2016
      2. The Bitcoin network is geographically more clustered than Ethereum
      3. Ethereum has lower mining power utilizations that Bitcoin and would benefit from a relay network
      4. Small miners experience more volatility in block rewards in Bitcoin than Ethereum

3. Bitcoin and Ethereum
  - Bitcoin and Ethereum use Nakamoto consesus to regulate transaction serialization in their blockchains
  - But they're significantly different in terms of their API, abstractions, and wire protocol
  - The Bitcoin Protocol
